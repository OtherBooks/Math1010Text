{ The SS Bigfoot leaves a harbor bound for Nessie Island which is 300 miles away at a bearing of N$32^{\circ}$E.  A storm moves in and after 100 miles, the captain of the Bigfoot finds he has drifted off course.  If his bearing to the harbor is now S$70^{\circ}$W, how far is the SS Bigfoot from Nessie Island?  Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a mile.  What course should the captain set to head to the island?  Round your angle to the nearest tenth of a degree.}
{ It is about 229.61 miles from the island and the captain should set a course of N$16.4^{\circ}$E to reach the island.}
