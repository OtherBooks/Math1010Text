{ Using a right triangle with a horizontal leg of length 100 and vertical leg with length 7, show that a 7\% grade means that the road (hypotenuse) makes about a $4^{\circ}$ angle with the horizontal.  (It will not be exactly $4^{\circ}$, but it's pretty close.) \label{firstroadgrade}}
{$\arctan\left(\frac{7}{100}\right) \approx 0.699$ radians, which is equivalent to $4.004^{\circ}$}
