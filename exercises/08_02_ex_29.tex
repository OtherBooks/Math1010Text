{ Carl spies a potential Sasquatch nest at a bearing of N$10^{\circ}$E and radios Jeff, who is at a bearing of N$50^{\circ}$E from Carl's position.  From Jeff's position, the nest is at a bearing of S$70^{\circ}$W. If Jeff and Carl are 500 feet apart, how far is Jeff from the Sasquatch nest?  Round your answer to the nearest foot.}
{Jeff is about 371 feet from the nest.}
