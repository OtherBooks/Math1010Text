{ If you apply the Law of Cosines to the ambiguous Angle-Side-Side (ASS) case, the result is a quadratic equation whose variable is that of the missing side. If the equation has no positive real zeros then the information given does not yield a triangle.  If the equation has only one positive real zero then exactly one triangle is formed and if the equation has two distinct positive real zeros then two distinct triangles are formed.  Apply the Law of Cosines to Exercises \ref{ambigfirst}, \ref{ambigsecond} and \ref{ambigthird} above in order to demonstrate this result.  }
