{ Along a long, straight stretch of mountain road with a 7\% grade, you see a tall tree standing perfectly plumb alongside the road.\footnote{The word `plumb' here means that the tree is perpendicular to the horizontal.}  From a point 500 feet downhill from the tree, the angle of inclination from the road to the top of the tree is $6^{\circ}$.  Use the Law of Sines to find the height of the tree.  (Hint: First show that the tree makes a $94^{\circ}$ angle with the road.) \label{lastroadgrade}}
{About 53 feet}
