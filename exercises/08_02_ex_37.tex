{ Given $\alpha = 30^{\circ}$ and $b = 10$, choose four different values for $a$ so that \begin{enumerate} \item the information yields no triangle \item the information yields exactly one right triangle \item the information yields two distinct triangles \item the information yields exactly one obtuse triangle \end{enumerate} Explain why you cannot choose $a$ in such a way as to have $\alpha = 30^{\circ}$, $b = 10$ and your choice of $a$ yield only one triangle where that unique triangle has three acute angles.}
