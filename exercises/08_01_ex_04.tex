{ \label{leftrightlondoneye} On page \pageref{equationsforcircularmotion} in Section \ref{cosinesinebeyond}, we found the $x$-coordinate of counter-clockwise motion on a circle of radius $r$ with angular frequency $\omega$ to be $x = r\cos(\omega t)$, where $t=0$ corresponds to the point $(r,0)$.  Suppose we are in the situation of Exercise \ref{heightlondoneye} above.  Find a sinsusoid which models the horizontal \textit{displacement} $x$ of the passenger from the center of the Eye in meters $t$ minutes after they board the Eye.  Here we take $x(t) > 0$ to mean the passenger is to the \textit{right} of the center, while $x(t) < 0$ means the passenger is to the \textit{left} of the center.}
{$x(t) = 67.5 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15} t - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 67.5 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15} t \right)$}
