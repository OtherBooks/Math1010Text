{ In Exercise \ref{yoyotrick} in Section \ref{Angles}, we introduced the yo-yo trick `Around the World' in which a yo-yo is thrown so it sweeps out a vertical circle.  As in that exercise, suppose the yo-yo string is 28 inches and it completes one revolution in 3 seconds.  If the closest the yo-yo ever gets to the ground is 2 inches, find a sinsuoid which models the height $h$ of the yo-yo above the ground in inches $t$ seconds after it leaves its lowest point.}
{$h(t) = 28\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3} t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) + 30$}
