{ A naturalist sets off on a hike from a lodge on a bearing of S$80^{\circ}$W.  After 1.5 miles, she changes her bearing to S$17^{\circ}$W and continues hiking for 3 miles.  Find her distance from the lodge at this point.  Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a mile.  What bearing should she follow to return to the lodge?  Round your angle to the nearest degree.}
{ She is about 3.92 miles from the lodge and her bearing to the lodge is N$37^{\circ}$E. }
