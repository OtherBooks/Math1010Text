{ A geologist wants to measure the diameter of a crater.   From her camp, it is 4 miles to the northern-most point of the crater and 2 miles to the southern-most point.  If the angle between the two lines of sight is $117^{\circ}$, what is the diameter of the crater?  Round your answer to the nearest hundredth of a mile.}
{ The diameter of the crater is about 5.22 miles.}
