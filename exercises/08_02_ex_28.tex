{ The captain of the SS Bigfoot sees a signal flare at a bearing of N$15^{\circ}$E from her current location. From his position, the captain of the HMS Sasquatch finds the signal flare to be at a bearing of N$75^{\circ}$W.  If the SS Bigfoot is 5 miles from the HMS Sasquatch and the bearing from the SS Bigfoot to the HMS Sasquatch is N$50^{\circ}$E, find the distances from the flare to each vessel, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile.}
{The SS Bigfoot is about 4.1 miles from the flare. \\The HMS Sasquatch is about 2.9 miles from the flare.}
