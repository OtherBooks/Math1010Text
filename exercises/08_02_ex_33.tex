{ The angle of depression from an observer in an apartment complex to a gargoyle on the building next door is $55^{\circ}$.  From a point five stories below the original observer, the angle of inclination to the gargoyle is $20^{\circ}$.  Find the distance from each observer to the gargoyle and the distance from the gargoyle to the apartment complex.  Round your answers to the nearest foot.  (Use the rule of thumb that one story of a building is 9 feet.)  }
{The gargoyle is about 44 feet from the observer on the upper floor. \\The gargoyle is about 27 feet from the observer on the lower floor. \\The gargoyle is about 25 feet from the other building.}
