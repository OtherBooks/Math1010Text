{ Suppose an object weighing $10$ pounds is suspended from the ceiling by a spring which stretches $2$ feet to its equilibrium position when the object is attached.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Find the spring constant $k$ in $\frac{\text{lbs.}}{\text{ft.}}$ and the mass of the object in slugs. 
\item   Find the equation of motion of the object if it is released from $1$ foot \textit{below} the equilibrium position from rest.  When is the first time the object passes through the equilibrium position? In which direction is it heading? 
\item   Find the equation of motion of the object if it is released from $6$ inches \textit{above} the equilibrium position with a \textit{downward} velocity of $2$ feet per second.  Find when the object passes through the equilibrium position heading downwards for the third time.
\end{enumerate}}
{\begin{enumerate} 
\item $k = 5 \, \frac{\text{lbs.}}{\text{ft.}}$ and $m = \frac{5}{16} \, \text{slugs}$ 
\item  $x(t) = \sin\left(4t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$.  The object first passes through the equilibrium point when $t = \frac{\pi}{8} \approx 0.39$ seconds after the motion starts.  At this time, the object is heading upwards. 
\item  $x(t) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin\left(4t + \frac{7\pi}{4}\right)$.  The object passes through the equilibrium point heading downwards for the third time when $t = \frac{17\pi}{16} \approx 3.34$ seconds. 
\end{enumerate}}
