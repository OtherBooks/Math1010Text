{ The sounds we hear are made up of mechanical waves.  The note `A' above the note `middle C' is a sound wave with ordinary frequency $f = 440$ Hertz $= 440 \frac{\text{cycles}}{\text{second}}$.  Find a sinusoid which models this note, assuming that the amplitude is $1$ and the phase shift is $0$.}
