{ Skippy and Sally decide to hunt UFOs.  One night, they position themselves 2 miles apart on an abandoned stretch of desert runway.  An hour into their investigation, Skippy spies a UFO hovering over a spot on the runway directly between him and Sally.  He records the angle of inclination from the ground to the craft to be $75^{\circ}$ and radios Sally immediately to find the angle of inclination from her position to the craft is $50^{\circ}$.  How high off the ground is the UFO at this point?  Round your answer to the nearest foot.  (Recall:  1 mile is 5280 feet.)}
{The UFO is hovering about 9539 feet above the ground.}
