{ From a point 300 feet above level ground in a firetower, a ranger spots two fires in the Yeti National Forest.  The angle of depression\footnote{See Exercise \ref{angleofdepression} in Section \ref{CircularFunctions} for the definition of this angle.} made by the line of sight from the ranger to the first fire is $2.5^{\circ}$ and the angle of depression made by line of sight from the ranger to the second fire is $1.3^{\circ}$.  The angle formed by the two lines of sight is $117^{\circ}$.  Find the distance between the two fires.  Round your answer to the nearest foot. (Hint: In order to use the $117^{\circ}$ angle between the lines of sight, you will first need to use right angle Trigonometry to find the lengths of the lines of sight.  This will give you a Side-Angle-Side case in which to apply the Law of Cosines.)

{ The fires are about 17456 feet apart. (Try to avoid rounding errors.)}
