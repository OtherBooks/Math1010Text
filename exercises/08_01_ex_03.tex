{ \label{heightlondoneye} The \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye}{\underline{London Eye}} is a popular tourist attraction in London, England and is one of the largest Ferris Wheels in the world.  It has a diameter of 135 meters and makes one revolution (counter-clockwise) every 30 minutes.  It is constructed so that the lowest part of the Eye reaches ground level, enabling passengers to simply walk on to, and off of, the ride.  Find a sinsuoid which models the height $h$ of the passenger above the ground in meters $t$ minutes after they board the Eye at ground level.}
{$h(t) = 67.5 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{15} t - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) + 67.5$}
