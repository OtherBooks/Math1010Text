{ A watchtower spots a ship off shore at a bearing of N$70^{\circ}$E.  A second tower, which is 50 miles from the first at a bearing of S$80^{\circ}$E from the first tower, determines the bearing to the ship to be N$25^{\circ}$W. How far is the boat from the second tower?  Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a mile.}
{The boat is about 25.1 miles from the second tower.}
